The study found that English school leavers have poorer literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills compared to their grandparents, making England the only country among 24 wealthy nations where this is the case. However, the analysis also revealed that the over-55s in Britain outperform their peers in other countries, which is attributed to the quality of education in the 1960s and 1970s. The decline in selective education, with the replacement of many grammar schools with comprehensives, corresponds with the last significant intake of grammar pupils whose scores today as over-55s are high. The study also found that individuals in almost every nation studied showed improvement in these areas until their mid to late-20s, followed by a decline until retirement due to general cognitive decline. However, the UK is an exception, with the older generation significantly outperforming contemporaries in other nations. The change in the school system from one based on ability to one where children went to any school, irrespective of ability, is believed to be a major factor in the decline. The introduction of comprehensives began in 1946 and expanded in 1965, and by 1975, most local authorities had adopted the comprehensive system.
